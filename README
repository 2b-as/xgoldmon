xgoldmon
========

xgoldmon is a small tool to convert the messages output by the USB
logging mode of phones with Intel/Infineon XGold baseband processor
back to the GSM/UMTS radio messages sent over the air so you can watch
them in e.g. Wireshark in realtime.
This includes signalling for calls, SMS, USSD, paging for your and
other phones and so on.

Currently, it works for the Samsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9300 and Galaxy S2
GT-I9100.

Patches for other devices or to decode more messages are very much
welcome!

How to build
============

xgoldmon has been tested on Linux and OSX.

As a prerequisite, libosmocore has to be installed. See here for
instructions: http://bb.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/libosmocore
(If you install it in a non-standard location please set
PKG_CONFIG_PATH accordingly.)

Then run "make" in the xgoldmon directory. An xgoldmon binary should
be created.


Before running xgoldmon
=======================

To enable the logging mode on the phone:
- Go to the Phone application, enter *#9900# and set "Debug Level
  Enabled" to "HIGH". The phone will reboot.
- Go to the Phone application again, enter *#7284# and set "USB" to
  "MODEM" and tap "SAVE and RESET". The phone will reboot again.

When connecting the phone via USB to the computer, several new
pseudo-tty devices should be created. The one with the second lowest
number should be the logging port. So for example on Linux, if you
have no other ttyACM* devices, it should be /dev/ttyACM1.

xgoldmon currently does not yet set any serial parameters on the
device, so on Linux you might have to do that yourself with something
like

  stty 115200 pass8 raw -noflsh </dev/ttyACM1


Running xgoldmon
================

E.g.:

  xgoldmon -t s3 -l /dev/ttyACM1

Full usage:
usage: ./xgoldmon [-t <phone type>] [-l] [-v] <logfile or device>
  -t: select 's2' or 's3' (default: 's3')
  -l: print baseband log messages
  -v: show debugging messages (more than once for more messages)

In some situations, the phone might close the device, causing xgoldmon
to exit. If you want to do some unsupervised logging, it might be a
good idea to put the call to xgoldmon in a loop.


Watching the radio messages in Wireshark
========================================

xgoldmon uses libosmocore to send the radio messages in GSMTAP format
(http://bb.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/GSMTAP) to UDP port 4729 on the local
host. In order to monitor the packages with Wireshark, something has
to listen on that port, e.g.

  nc -u -l 4729

Then, in Wireshark, start a capture on the loopback interface. To see
only the GSMTAP messages, set this filter:

  udp.port==4729

A word about UMTS: UMTS support in GSMTAP is still preliminary and so
support for it is not yet included in Wireshark. You will see the
GSMTAP messages in Wireshark, but they currently will not be
decoded. I hope this will be resolved soon. For the time being, use
GSM.

making this tool!
